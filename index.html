          <h2>About Me
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am a well-organized, dedicated, and eager to learn.
            I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease.
            
            I believe that a person should work on developing their
            professional skills and learning new things all the time.
            
            Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities which my
            current job position cannot provide.

          <p>
            Portfolio Empowering people and their business through
            technology. </p> 
            <p> Creating engaging, purposeful and
            creative websites. Helping setting up social media
            profiles and anything that has to do with establishing

            <p> I believe that no matter the size, every business needs
              a well designed website. Whether it's to increase visibility,
              establish online presence, increase sales and/or leads, nowadays
              having a website is crucial for the success of a business.

            This time last year I was pursuing a career in Cloud
            Computing but unfortunately due to complications this
            failed and I am now pursuing a career as a Web
            Developer as I believe this is a powerful platform to
            enchance my online presence and empowering teams.
